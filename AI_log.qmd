## 

1.  Tools Used: chatgpt

2.  Prompt(s): paste exact prompt(s) used

    1.  "can you show individual data points when using geom_path"

        1.  AI output: "Yes â€” absolutely! `geom_path()` (or `geom_line()`) **only draws lines connecting points by default**, but you can also show the individual points **on top of the line** by adding `geom_point()` to the same plot."

    2.  quarto document shortcut for creating new codechunk in rstudio

        1.  AI output: showed me the right shortcut

3.  Edits made and rationale: what was changed, why, and what was learned

    1.  These didn't lead to huge changes but more helped me when I was stuck. Mostly it was stuff I'd learned before but forgot.

4.  Verification: how correctness was checked (unit tests, small examples, benchmarks)

    1.  These two examples were easy to verify. For the shortcut, I simply tried it in Rstudio. For geom_point(), I just added that line after my geom_path() line and the graph was what I wanted. For both, they were things I've learned before but couldn't remember, so verification was easy

## Reflection questions

#### **Reflection Questions:**

#### **When is vectorization preferable to loops in R, and when are loops the right choice? Provide two concrete examples from the assignment.**

The assignment this week showed that for loops take more time than vectorization. It didn't have a noticeable effect in this week's example, but would become more relevant as the size of the dataset increases. For loops, on the other hand, seem to give you a greater degree of control over whats being calculated, and would be more useful for more complicated/advanced tasks that require more specification.\

#### **Which AI prompt was most helpful? What did you learn, and how was correctness verified? Include before/after code snippets with commentary.**

I think I've found it most useful for those "wait how do I do this agian?" moments. It's things I've already learned but can't recall at that moment.

code before:

df_combined \|\>

ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = avg_height)) +

geom_path()

code after:

df_combined \|\>

ggplot(aes(x = month_year, y = avg_height)) +

geom_path() +

geom_point()

In this case, I couldn't remember how to get both the line and the plot points on the same graph. Specifically, I was under the incorrect assumption that to add the points, I should use an argument WITHIN geom_path(), rather than adding geom_point() below. In this case, as soon as I saw the chatgpt response I remembered doing this before. It just sparked my memory. Again this was easy to verify.
